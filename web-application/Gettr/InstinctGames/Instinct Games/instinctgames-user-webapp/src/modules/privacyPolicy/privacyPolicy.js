                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your
                identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have
                the information in our system. These verification efforts
                require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
                match it with information you have previously provided us. For
                instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may
                ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
                information you provide with the information we already have on
                file, or we may contact you through a communication method
                (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
                We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
                dictate.

                We will only use personal information provided in your request

                extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
                from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
                verify your identity from the information already maintained by
                us, we may request that you provide additional information for
                the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
                fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
                provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
